It was great to get to speak with you today.  

Below is the information that I will need in order to start scheduling interviews.  Also attached/included is quite a bit of interview prep information.

I look forward to hearing back from you!

Items needed to start Scheduling Interviews

1.  Your availability for interviews (please provide a 4-5 days and times between 10-4pm EST).  The initial phone screen will take around 45 minutes.  

2.  An updated copy of your resume.

3.  The names of any Google employees you may know.  


Interview Prep 
Attached is some material to help you prepare for your technical conversations. Inside the information there will be a few links, a video, and also a few practice problems to help you know what to expect.  We understand that the interviews tend to be more fundamental - data structures, algorithms, and coding - and different than what you are doing in your day to day. This will help you get geared up for the call.

General Tips
Many candidates have also found it helpful to practice writing their code in a Google doc and the running test cases on the code and optimizing it (Link). 

Basics to practice heavily
- writing your favorite O(nlogn) sort
- various BST traversals (left-to-right, etc.)
- writing (and debugging) binary search
- DP algorithms like edit distance
